### Climate
Since Black-Skull was built in a plateau inside a very opened chamber, the climate there is windy, it may be difficult, but also provides for mechanical powers to make flour and other goods.
Some days are unbearable, though, the city has developed some safety mechanism for any wind related catastrophes including protection bunkers and escape routes

### Resources
![[Black Wood.png#circle|left|c-p-sm|215]]
Cascading down from the ceiling to the floor, thick and gigantic black roots fill the chamber, the Black Wood is the main resource of Black Skull, there are also goods that are hard to find anywhere else, since black wood is a hub for [[The Black Market]]. 

The Black Wood provided by this city is also a Luxurious Good, and it may cost several [[Gromia]]. This sole good movements the market of Black Skull to make it one of the wealthiest cities on the surrounding area, together with The Black Market, it makes Black Skull a den for villains who are powerful and full of resources.

Another important resource of Black Skull is the Gromia Stone, made to make the currency of the Den, it may be just a place for mining and exploration, since the stones are cut and minted in the Central Bank on [[Wooden Den]], but it is a good that provides a lot of financial resources for the city.
