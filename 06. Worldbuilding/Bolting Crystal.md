# Bolting Crystal
![[shard.jpg#circle|right|220]]
A Bolting Crystal is what allows magic to happen in The Deep.
Magic is considered a volatile type of Energy that has random properties yet far to be totally understood, sometimes it changes to matter, normally on gas state. When those "Magic gases" appear between earth crust layers, with time and the built up pressure, they crystallize. So Bolting Crystals are basically crystals of pure magic.

## Usage
Normally they are used to tap into the magical energy and make one able to cast spells that need material ingredients to be used.
Although, Bolting Crystals can have some different uses.

>[!tip|wmed]+ For Casting
>If a spell doesn't require a Bolting Crystal you can use one to replace any Material Component of a spell

Also, **Bolting Crystals** have a special ability called **Crystal Ignition** It envolves harvesting energy from a crystal and redirecting it back to it, it may be dangerous and the effects can be seen on the following table

| dice: 1d20 | Effect |
|------------|---|
|    1-5     | Sparks fill the room, the creatures within a 13 feet radius may make a **CON** saving throw, if not passed they take `dice: 1d6` damage |
|    6-10    | A  shock-wave originating from the Ignition to a 29 feet radius happens, creatures within the are go 34 feet backwards and must pass a **CON** saving throw, not passing means `dice: 2d8` force damage|
|   10-15    | On a circular area of 29 feet radius reality bends, all the creatures within may do a **CON** saving throw, passing it means loosing `dice: 1d8` Hit Points **permanently**, not passing you loose `dice: 1d8` Hit Points permanently and also `dice: 1d4` is reducted to the value of your strongest attribute (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) . The caster of the ignition is also affected |
|   15- 20   | Explosion, the Crystal used to perform the Ignition is destroyed! all the creatures within a 29 feet radius of the caster and including him must do a **CON** saving throw, passing you loose `dice: 2d8` Hit Points Permanently, not passing means losing the same amount `dice: 2d8` and also you have the Effect *Monstrification* upon you|
