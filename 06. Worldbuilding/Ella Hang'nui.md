> “Ella is feared by her seriousness, height, and the stories people heard about her, but she is actually very protective and sweet towards her loved ones, even considering her demanding and serious tone” – [[Nina Hawun]]


## Appearance
Ella possesses an imposing stature, her height slightly above the average. Her hair, as black as a raven's wing, flows in long, smooth waves, cascading to the midpoint of her back. Her body, slender and elongated, is reminiscent of a willowy reed, swaying with grace and flexibility.

Yet, beneath the surface of her slim physique, a hidden strength resides. Her muscles, though not overly pronounced, hint at a latent power, a testament to her physical prowess. Her bosom, of medium size, is subtly accentuated, drawing attention without being overt. Her thighs, robust and shapely, bear the unmistakable marks of strength, a visible testament to her vigor and vitality.

Ella's countenance carries an air of serene confidence, her eyes sparkling with an inner fire that is both captivating and intriguing. They are the windows to her soul, revealing a spirit that is as fierce as it is gentle. Her lips, often curved in a thoughtful smile, add to her enigmatic charm, making one wonder about the depths of wisdom and experiences that they hide.

Her movements are fluid and graceful, like a dancer in tune with the rhythm of life. Each stride she takes is filled with purpose, a testament to her determination and resolve. The sway of her hair with every step she takes, the gentle flexing of her lithe muscles, and the soft, yet firm timbre of her voice, all paint a picture of a woman who is comfortable in her skin and unafraid of the world. Ella is more than just her physical attributes; she is strength personified, a beacon of resilience and grace.

Yet, this robust exterior houses a heart that is as tender as it is tenacious.

To those she holds dear, Ella unveils a gentler side of her, a side that is as sweet and soft as a summer breeze. She cares deeply, her affection as vast and encompassing as the ocean. Her kindness is infectious, her generosity, boundless. She possesses the rare ability to balance strength with softness, proving that one can be both a warrior and a nurturer.

## Interests
As a fierce warrior and an adept monster huntress, Ella's interests are deeply rooted in her adventurous and daring nature. She has an inherent fascination with the unknown, a curiosity that drives her to explore the uncharted territories and face the creatures that lurk within. She thrives on the thrill of the hunt, the adrenaline rush that comes with tracking and subduing formidable beasts.

Her interest extends beyond just the physical aspect of her profession. She is a student of the natural world, studying the habits and habitats of the creatures she hunts. She is well-versed in the lore of monsters, understanding their strengths and weaknesses, their behaviors and patterns.

Ella also has a deep appreciation for martial arts and weaponry. She spends countless hours honing her combat skills, mastering various weapons and learning new fighting techniques. Her weapons are not just tools for her, they are extensions of herself, symbols of her strength and determination.

Despite her warrior spirit, Ella also has a softer side. She has a fondness for nature and finds peace in the quiet moments amidst the wild. She enjoys the simple pleasures of life - the chirping of birds at dawn, the rustling of leaves under her feet, the quiet hum of the forest at night.

She is also a lover of stories and legends, often finding herself lost in the pages of ancient texts and mythical tales. She believes in the power of stories, in their ability to inspire, to teach and to heal.
