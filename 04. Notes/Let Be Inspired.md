# Let Be Inspired.

The advantages of letting others determine who you are.

## Let People Inspire you.

People, same as us, are the creatures we most see in the world. They influence us, teach us how to be part of their group, determine what we must do and what we must see, eat, drink. How we must talk, among other things.

The curious part, however, is that with all those rules being forced upon us, we still find glee and passion on being humans.
And that is because, while there are people trying to make us fir in a template, other people are not. They are actually doing the opposite. We look at them, the different ones, and, somewhere inside us, something resonates.

And when someone play their guitar, and your guitar's strings also resonate, that's being inspired.
And that's how. Not only limited to this, but that's how we connect as people, finding those **Hidden Similarities**

## Why "Hidden" Similarities?

Long story short: Hidden because they escape the template that _"Society"_ made us follow. The odd ones out, those are the people that most inspire us. But who are those odd ones? Well, it really depends on how you see the world. 
And that's what is beautiful about it, different people inspire different people. The things that you like, the hobbies that you have, everything. It was acquired from someone else, something else.

## How to: Be Inspired.

Getting information and making notes for the ones that resonate with you and their work may be a good practice for understanding what inspires you
