## Thoughts

Yesterday I met with friends, Finally! Me and Daniel talked a lot, and it was an interesting conversation. I toke some [[Atom Notes]] during the talk, and it was awesome. I also met Larissa and a friend of them. Today i also improved Homepage a bit more, connecting my MOCs
About the improvements I talked on [Intro](#intro), I already made them by now. It's `$=moment(dv.current().static).format("HH:mm")` now. I also thought of taking at least a note today, let's see how it will be at the end of the day.
