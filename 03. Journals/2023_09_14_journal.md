## Intro

Hello, Journal! Today has been nice, I tried, and actually succeed on updating the Journal page of my Obsidian's Homepage. More to come bellow.

## Thoughts

I want to work more on our little card game and try to enhance this Homepage. it's been fun, I'll search for more tips on forum and fully organize things here.
I want to fully embrace this Homepage and let it help me to organize my thoughts and creative production.
I hope that, with my Homepage and my medicine, I can focus on things I enjoy, and also help with my financial resources. That said, let's continue the day.
